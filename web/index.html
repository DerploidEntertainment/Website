                                It's simple: score points by choosing the winning hand before time runs out.
                                The longer you last, the harder it gets.
                                How high will you score?

                                <h3>Part Dan. Part Matt. All Derp.</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Derploid® Entertainment was founded by Dan Vicarel and Matt Samardge.
                                    After meeting at a Cleveland Game Developers social in summer 2017,
                                    they quickly determined that their shared interests and complementary skills could support an independent game development studio:
                                    Dan had the programming experience and familiarity with game engines to <em>build</em> a game,
                                    while Matt had the visual and musical background to give it polish.
                                    By August, they had registered Derploid Entertainment, LLC in the state of Ohio and were ready to make games!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Throughout the following years, Matt and Dan methodically built up their skills and portfolios.
                                    They both had day jobs to work around and families to support, but they always found time
                                    to participate in game jams, collaborate with fellow Cleveland Game Developers, and
                                    attend conferences like GDEX and Origins Game Fair.
                                    In May of 2020, Derploid took on its first professional contract with Solidplasma Studios,
                                    contributing artwork and building out the entire cloud infrastructure for Solidplasma's game,
                                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1300330/Farmageddon_A_Cattle_Royale/"><cite>Farmageddon: A Cattle Royale</cite></a>,
                                    released in 2021. With the success of that game, Matt and Dan were ready to devote themselves to an original project.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Matt had worked at Jack Casino in Cleveland for several years, so he pitched the idea for a simple mobile game
                                    to help players recognize Poker hands faster. This idea would grow into <cite>{{ site.highHandHoldem.productName }}</cite>,
                                    described <a href="#hhh-ad">above</a>.
                                    Still navigating family life and day jobs,
                                    Matt and Dan are working hard to release the game in Q2 2026. After that, you'll have to wait and see!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Derploid® will always be committed to making the world a better place with engaging and stimulating game experiences.
                                    We firmly believe that games should be fun and lucrative without being exploitative.
                                    Someday soon, we hope to bring on more team members whose skills and values align with ours.
