# Derploid Website Jekyll Site

This folder contains the Jekyll source code for the Derploid website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Contributing

See [Jekyll CLI usage](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) for commands to build and run the site locally.
As of this writing, the command you'll probably want is:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
